# atlanta-rocks-project

Created by: William Huizenga

Atlanta Rocks is owned by Atlanta Rocks! and I have no affiliation with them.

### Project Description
Currently at Atlanta Rocks all the routes and difficulties are printed on paper and laid around the gym. I decided to make an app that would allow a user to access that information from the palm of their hand. I also wanted to make it a little more social with comment features.

Eventually I would like to add the ability to have users add climbs to their account page and keep track of how they are doing as they become better and better climbers.
